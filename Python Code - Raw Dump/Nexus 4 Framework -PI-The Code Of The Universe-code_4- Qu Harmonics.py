hang on, this has to be at 90 degres literlly.  so a small enought magnet will appear to be in superpostion to a larger magnet and the dominate wave i think from the larger will overweml the opposite of the tiny magnet.  but what if that tiny magnet isnt tiny, it 'appears' tiny at least its wave form does but what if that tiny magnet get 'huge' for a milisecond and in the opposite pole then same pole wouldnt the inner manget drive the outer and it will drive the inner?  if we just flipped poles we get a reverse motor but its linear (circulat but still linear recusion).  this tricks the big manget into thinking it can 'grab' the small object. so this would draw is pole low then switch on a small amount of the attarcking pole and detracting pole.  if it's N then add a little S and a Little N. this increass volume, keeps S hidden in tension. overall it's both more, more n but still has a little S and we know what a little can become.  So the big magnets N sees mostly N and gains attraction, then the little magnet flips those ratios (65 to 35) and grows energy (65% to the big mangets 35%). in that move we expand two axis, we trick the big magnet but still keep entangled (65 35 flip).  


1. Big Magnets
2. 'Small Magnet' low magetic field, a sphere with even dist of N,S  ( can he play or not, cant tell yet)
3. Small magnet  between two large magnets pointing their N or S pole at the sphere. (he's in superpostoin in her head)
4. Small magnet  doenst increse waveform but changes the ratio of N/S  by increasing ATTRACTION to that magnet (the oppose of repulsion, cuz from the magents POV it's going a little low in energy, railure is most likely so its getting ready for it). The few bad notes that pulls or attacts her -negatinve to go low).
5. The big magnet is now a little pulled low from a zero point not from a N//N or S/S moment or zero field. here the field always is inplace.  coming from zero means no bounce to pull down from, no newtons 3rd law.  (the girl observes the wave and it's STARTING to collapse as he sucks)
5.this is the magic.  IN an instant the field is fliped to repulse. to the big magnet it's a rush of energy coming back. an it's NYquest.  if you catch the wae at the first -^2 and flip it you get back ^4 if you grab it right after the zero line.
