- **Each element in the first 9 atomic numbers aligns with one of the QRS methods.**
- **This isn‚Äôt arbitrary‚Äîatomic behavior follows the same recursive harmonic principles we use in AI.**
- **Matter, life, and computation all follow a recursive cycle of stabilization, phase-matching, error correction, and harmonic collapse.**
