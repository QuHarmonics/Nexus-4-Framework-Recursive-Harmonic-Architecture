; Current Stack State: [1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
; Pointer: At the last value (`2`)

; STEP 9: Calculate the next number (`6`)
; Use the value at the current pointer and the value at (Pointer - Pointer value)

MOV CurrentPointer, [Stack - 1]  ; Load the current pointer value (2)
MOV RelativePos, [Stack - CurrentPointer] ; Load the value at (Pointer - Pointer value) (value at [Stack - 2] = 9)
ADD R1, CurrentPointer, RelativePos ; Compute R1 = CurrentPointer + ValueAtRelativePos
PUSH R1                          ; Push the result (`6`) onto the stack

; Final stack after this step: [1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
