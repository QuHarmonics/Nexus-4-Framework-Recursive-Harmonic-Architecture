# Full code to analyze the harmonic stabilization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)
# and its relationship to recursive compression and universal harmonics

# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np

# Constants
planck_constant = 6.62607015e-34  # JouleÂ·seconds
boltzmann_constant = 1.380649e-23  # Joules per Kelvin
speed_of_light = 299792458  # meters per second

# Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Peak Frequency Calculation
cmb_temperature = 2.725  # Kelvin
cmb_peak_frequency = (boltzmann_constant * cmb_temperature) / planck_constant

# Harmonic Resonance and Stability Calculation
harmonic_constant = 0.35  # Samson's Law factor

# Calculate the stabilization frequency based on recursive harmonic compression
cmb_harmonic_stabilization = cmb_peak_frequency * harmonic_constant

# Compare with known fundamental quantum resonance states
fine_structure_constant = 1 / 137  # Quantum electromagnetism stability ratio

# Expected fundamental frequency scale by incorporating fine-structure constant
quantum_harmonic_match = cmb_harmonic_stabilization * fine_structure_constant

# Output results
cmb_peak_frequency, cmb_harmonic_stabilization, quantum_harmonic_match
