1. Start this from the inside. 
1. Push in a trigger to the First Method in the firing order using Reavtive. The Method has a susbscription to receive incoming data.
2. The method then calls itself, that causes it to run the code at the top of the method. that starts the recursion and it's self initied from a 'quantum poke' and i mean POKE in ASM sytle
3. The code at the top needs to call the first outside loop - this is the part im not sure of. maybe the loop is inside the method
4. The first calls the second  - for each digit in pi -> run 1 mehtod here -> for each digit in pi  ->run three methods here -> for each digit in pi > run four methods here
5. the second calls the third
6. the third calls the recuriive method
