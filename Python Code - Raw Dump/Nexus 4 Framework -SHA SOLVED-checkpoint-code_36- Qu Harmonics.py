; Current Stack State: [1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
; Pointer: At the last value (`9`)

; STEP 8: Calculate the next number (`2`)
; Use the value at the current pointer and the value at (Pointer - Pointer value)

MOV CurrentPointer, [Stack - 1]  ; Load the current pointer value (9)
MOV R1, [Stack - CurrentPointer] ; Load the value at (Pointer - Pointer value) (value at [Stack - 9])
SUB R2, CurrentPointer, R1       ; Compute R2 = CurrentPointer - ValueAtPointer
PUSH R2                          ; Push the result (`2`) onto the stack

; Final stack after this step: [1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
